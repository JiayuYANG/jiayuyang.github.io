[CVP-MVSNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08329) (CVPR 2020 Oral) is a cost volume pyramid based depth inference framework for Multi-View Stereo. 

CVP-MVSNet is compact, lightweight, fast in runtime and can  handle  high  resolution  images  to  obtain  high  quality depth map for 3D reconstruction.
