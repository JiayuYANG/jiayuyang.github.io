### Self-supervised Learning of Depth Inference for Multi-view Stereo (CVPR 2021)

Self-supervised-CVP-MVSNet is the self-supervised version of CVP-MVSNet.
It can achieve performance similar to supervised CVP-MVSNet without requiring any ground-truth depth training data.

### Cost Volume Pyramid Based Depth Inference for Multi-View Stereo (CVPR 2020 Oral) 

CVP-MVSNet is a cost volume pyramid based depth inference framework for Multi-View Stereo. 
It is compact, lightweight, fast in runtime and can  handle  high  resolution  images  to  obtain  high  quality depth map for 3D reconstruction.
